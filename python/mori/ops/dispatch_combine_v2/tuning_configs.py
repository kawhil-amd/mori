"""Per-device, per-shape block/warp tuning for the cco-LSA dispatch/combine

Geometry is picked per device (MI308X / MI300X / MI355X), then by
(world_size, hidden_dim, topk). Devices are told apart by PCI device id (MI300X
and MI308X are both gfx942, differing only in CU count), falling back to arch for
gfx950 — all from KFD sysfs, no torch/HIP dependency. block_num must stay

# Key lessons: (a) dispatch load-once has a SHARP resonance at block=256 (== the

# the disp column flips 256x32 (original, many warps to fill the grid) -> 256x8
# (load-once) exactly across the 4096 threshold. (b) below the threshold 256x32w wins
# (4096=756, 1024=428); <=256 tok is latency-flat (~140, any geom). (c) COMBINE also
# wants block=256 (=CU): the old "<CU, 192 ceiling" guardrail was too conservative —
# 256 blocks stay co-resident (1/CU) and win big: 8192 256x8w=968 vs 192x16=816 (+19%),
